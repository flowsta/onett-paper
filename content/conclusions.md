## Conclusions and Future Work
{:#conclusions}
The availability of homogeneous transport data from worldwide transport authorities and operators gives us the possibility of creating new types of applications related to transport (trip planners, fare calculators, ticket recommenders, etc.) that can be deployed easily in different regions or cities. In this paper, we have shown our approach to create such homogeneous transport data based on declarative mappings that can be used to generate transport knowledge graphs for any region or city in the world that is currently publishing data in GTFS. The mappings allow transforming GTFS data into RDF according to a TransModel-based ontology. Such data can be queried in a homogeneous manner so that the aforementioned applications can be created more easily.
